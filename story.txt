Chapter 1
===================

The Lands Between were ruled over by Queen Marika the Eternal, a being chosen by the Greater Will, 
who acted as a guardian and keeper of the Elden Ring and had numerous children.
 She also purposefully altered it and removed the Rune of Destined Death,
 making anybody under the Grace of the Elden Ring immortal.
 All people were affected in this way, but the Elden Ring and Erdtree seemed to reject some of them,
 marking them as Tarnished who were sent into exile.
 They still couldn't die, but they had been marked as unworthy in some way.
