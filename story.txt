Chapter 0
==================
Marika had two husbands at different times during her rule: Godfrey, who became Tarnished himself and went into exile, 
then Radagon, the mysterious red-haired warrior. Both of these men became Elden Lords and gained much divine power through this union with
Marika - in fact,while Marika is a supremely powerful being, her consorts, aka the Elden Lords, seem to be almost as powerful as she is.
